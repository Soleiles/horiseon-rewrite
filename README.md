# horiseon-rewrite

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to improve upon the given starter code by including semantic HTML elements as well as condense and resolve any issues that may have carried over into the style.css sheet. In addition, The index.html was organized and spaced to be read in an easier fashion. The title of the URL has been updated to a concise and meaningful name. This project helped me develop more understanding of semantic HTML elements as well as the importance of simplification of code and organization.
